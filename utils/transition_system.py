    Designed to access a dataframe in a windowed fashion, meaning if you want to access last n elements from a given index position. E.g you want to access previous 2 elements from any index. So for index values going like:
    0, 1, 2, 3, 4 the function will return [0,1], [0,2], [0,3], [1,4], [2,5]

        current_index: The index position in the dataframe.
        window_size: Size of the window that is created by this function.
        end_exclusive: Normally this is the case, example with list slicing in python. But sometimes like with pandas
                      .loc the end_index can be inclusive as well. In that case set `False`.
